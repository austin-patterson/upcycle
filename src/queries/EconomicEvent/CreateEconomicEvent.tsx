 * This is the graphQL mutation that will create the Economic Event.

 * using the back ticks `` instead of quotes. It brings in all variables
 * by defining them with the $ in the header, and then references them
 * in the query. The variables are injected using Apollo before it is
 * sent. Notice at the end the ${EconomicEventFragment}. This is bringing
 * in the fragment defined at ./EconomicEvent.tsx. By using the fragment,
 * we don't need to redefine what we want back from an EconomicEvent. The
 * syntax for inserting the fragment, ${}, is part of the Javascript

 * EconomicEvent, preceded by ...
